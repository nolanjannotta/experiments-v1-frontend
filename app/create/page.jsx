    <p>
        to create an edition, you&apos;ll need to provide the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
            <li>
                a name for your edition.
            </li>
            <li>
                a description of your edition.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total supply of your edition.
            </li>
            <li>
                address of the Art Generator contract. 
            </li>
            <li>
                address of the artist. <small>(the address must be owned by the artist, this is used to change other setting for the edition. )</small>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>note: this information cannot be changed afterwards. also, the art generator needs to be deployed and the code verified before hand. This is so I can read the code and make sure it roughly aligns with the core values of Onchain-Experiments_V1â„¢. </b></p>
    <br/> 
    <p>
        as an artist, you&apos;ll be in control of the following things: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                setting the mint status of your edition <small>(active/inactive)</small>. All editions start as inactive by default. Can be toggled back and forth at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
                If zero tokens in your edition have been minted, you can delete it. However, the edition id assigned to that edition cant be reused.
            </li>
            <li>
                setting and changing the price of your edition.
            </li>
            <li> 
                setting the royalty percentage for your edition.
            </li>
            <li>
                setting the signature id for you edition <small>(optional)</small>. This uses edition #1 of this project <small>(&apos;signatures&apos;)</small> to &apos;sign&apos; each token in your edition. 
                The signature id must be owned by the artist&apos;s address. The signature will appear in the bottom right corner of each token in your edition.
            </li>
            <li>
                artists are also able to mint their own editions through a special function. This bypasses the msg.value check and mint status check. This could be handy if
                you pause your edition near the end of the supply, but you want to mint and send token to a friend for example without needing 
                to unpause and risking someone minting in front of you.  
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Obviously, this is all done onchain &#9786; these settings can be set <Link href="/artist">here</Link>. Connect your wallet and your editions will appear.

        </p>

        <h3>fees:</h3>

        <p>
            if you set a mint price for your edition, a 5-10% &apos;protocol fee&apos; is subtracted from your revenue. In addition, a 5-10% fee is applied to your royalty percentage. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>
            you set a 10% royalty on your edition
            </li>
            <li>
            platform royalty fee is 5%
            </li>
            <li>
            A token is sold for 1 eth
            </li>
            <li>
            total royalty is .1 eth
            </li>
            <li>
            artist keep .095 eth
            </li>
            <li>
            platform keeps .005 eth
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            This fee will help me continue to sponsor the gas fees for minting and other operations, keep the lights on, and continue to develop this project.
