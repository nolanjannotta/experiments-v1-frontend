        <p>
            A major goal of this project is to normalize offering high quality archival grade prints
            for onchain art NFTs directly from the creater. 
            When it comes to this project, this depends entirely on whether theres any interest whatsoever from collectors. 
            If there is, I will personally buy a printer and get this whole thing started.

    <figcaption>Vision:</figcaption>
            <ul>
        <li>Highest quality reasonably possible. (Epson P700, possibly P900 )</li>
        <li>All printing, packaging and shipping will be done by hand by me.</li>
        <li>All packaging will be 100% recycleable.</li>
        <li>Ideally shipped anywhere in the world. Hand delivered if in LA area.</li>
        <li>The revenue from the prints will be split between the artist, the owner of the piece being printed, and the printer. Percentages TBD. </li>
        <li>Prints will be priced in Eth. </li>
        <li> All payments, royalties etc and as much business logic as possible will take place on chain. Things like shipping addresses will need to be handled elsewhere, possibly Coinbase Commerce?</li>
        <li>Will include the SVG code printed on the back or on a seperate peice of paper. </li>
        <li>May include some sort of watermark or some kind of cryptographic signed message for authenticity.</li>
